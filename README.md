# Choosetime

Choosetime forces a customer to choose a time before they can add anything to their cart.

This is free and doesn't require a license, but you can [donate to Ryan](https://github.com/sponsors/ryanmitchell), the developer behind it, to show your appreciation.

### Installation
Upload to extensions in the following folder format:

`extensions/thoughtco/choosetime/`

In the admin user interface enable the extension.
